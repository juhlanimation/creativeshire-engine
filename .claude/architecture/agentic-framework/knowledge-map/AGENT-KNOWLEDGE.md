## By Agent Type

### Builders

- Count: 15
- Avg Explicit Tokens: 8,804
- Avg Glob Tokens: 0

### Reviewers

- Count: 12
- Avg Explicit Tokens: 8,134
- Avg Glob Tokens: 0

### Coordinators

- Count: 14
- Avg Explicit Tokens: 5,581
- Avg Glob Tokens: 10,024

## Agents with High Glob Dependency

These agents load more context from glob patterns than explicit references:

- **project-assistant**: 100% glob (93,690 tokens)
- **technical-director**: 91% glob (46,643 tokens)

## Agents with No Explicit Knowledge

These agents only cover files through glob patterns (may lack focused knowledge):

- **project-assistant**: 45 files via glob

## ⚠️ Agents with No Coverage (Broken Paths)

These agents' knowledge paths don't match any files in creativeshire.
Their paths need to be fixed in their contract files:

- **cleanup-agent** (coordinator)
- **contractor** (coordinator)
