# Category Mapping for Tailwind CSS v4 Best Practices
#
# This file defines stable bundle categories that agents reference.
# When upstream updates rules, run `npm run sync:tailwind-rules` to regenerate bundles.
# Agent contracts reference bundles/*.md - never rule paths directly.
#
# Mapping logic: Rules are matched by filename prefix.
