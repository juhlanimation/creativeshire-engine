# Category Mapping for React Best Practices
#
# This file defines stable bundle categories that agents reference.
# When Vercel updates their rules, run `npm run sync:react-rules` to regenerate bundles.
# Agent contracts reference bundles/*.md - never upstream paths directly.
#
# Mapping logic: Rules are matched by filename prefix.
