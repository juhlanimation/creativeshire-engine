# Presets

**Templates copied as starting point for sites.**

Preset = bundled configuration (theme, chrome, experience, page templates)
Site = assembled instance that uses/extends a preset

Flow: User picks preset → copied to site/ → customized in CMS

Before creating:
- Are you using GENERIC components with configurable values?
- No site-specific components—configure existing ones.
- Preset name only appears here, never in component names.

Spec: [preset.spec.md](/.claude/skills/engine/specs/components/preset/preset.spec.md)
