# Layout Widgets

**Structure only. Holds children. No content.**

Examples: Stack, Grid, Flex, Split, Container, Box

Before creating:
- Does it ONLY define structure (no images, text, icons)?
- Does it accept `children` or `widgets`?
- Has content or state? → Move to interactive/
- Every layout folder needs a meta.ts for platform UI hints
