# Drivers

**Infrastructure that provides input to behaviours.**

Examples: ScrollDriver, VisibilityDriver

Before creating:
- Does this observe/track something (scroll, visibility, resize)?
- Does it update shared state for behaviours to consume?
- Is it generic infrastructure, not widget-specific?
