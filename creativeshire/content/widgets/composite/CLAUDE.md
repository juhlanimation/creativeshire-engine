# Composites

**Layout + Primitives assembled.**

Two patterns:
- `create*` factory → returns WidgetSchema (declarative)
- React component → for complex local state

Before creating:
- Is this Layout(Primitives)? Not a primitive or layout alone?
- Is the name generic? (not `BojuhlCard`, just `ProjectCard`)
- Enough settings for different sites?
