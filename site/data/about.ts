  'Over the past decade, I\'ve led animated films and campaigns for Riot Games, Netflix, Supercell, Amazon, and LEGO - first at Sun Creature, now through my own studio, <a href="https://crossroad.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crossroad</a>.',
  "I was one of the original founders of Sun Creature and spent more than a decade helping shape its growth - guiding dozens of productions and working with hundreds of artists as the studio evolved from a small team to a large international company. I stepped away from the studio in early 2024 to pursue new paths.",
  'Today, <a href="https://crossroad.studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crossroad</a> is a remote-first setup rooted in collaboration and craft. I also take on freelance and consultancy work - always excited to dive in and make strong work with good people.',
